That **globe icon** is shown because your website currently **doesn’t have a favicon configured (or Google can’t detect it)**.
To display your logo (instead of the default globe) in search results and browser tabs, you need to add a **favicon**.

Here’s how to fix it:

---

### **1. Create a Favicon**

* Prepare your logo in a **square format** (preferably 512×512px for best quality).
* Save it as:

  * `favicon.ico` (classic)
  * and also `favicon.png` (modern browsers, transparent background).
* Keep the file size under **50KB** for fast loading.

---

### **2. Place It in Your Website Root**

Upload `favicon.ico` and `favicon.png` to the root of your site:

```
https://kk-barberacademy.pl/favicon.ico
https://kk-barberacademy.pl/favicon.png
```

---

### **3. Add These Tags in `<head>` of Your Website**

Edit your main HTML template and insert:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" sizes="any">
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="/favicon.png">
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" sizes="180x180" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
<link rel="manifest" href="/site.webmanifest">
<meta name="theme-color" content="#000000">
```

If you want the icon for **mobile (Apple/Android)** too, also add:

```html
<link rel="apple-touch-icon" href="/apple-touch-icon.png">
```

---

### **4. Clear Cache & Test**

* After uploading, clear your browser cache.
* Use [Google’s Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) or [Favicon Checker](https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon_checker) to confirm it’s working.
* Google may take **a few days to update** the icon in search results, but it should immediately work in browser tabs.

Would you like me to:

1. **Generate a favicon set (16×16, 32×32, 180×180, 512×512)** from your logo?
2. Or **create a `site.webmanifest` file** (so Google shows your icon in search and mobile install prompts)?
3. Or **both (full package)** so you just upload and it works?

Which do you prefer? Or **all together as a ready-to-upload ZIP**?
